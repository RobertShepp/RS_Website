# âœ… Setup Complete - Image Files Now Used!

## **What I Just Did:**

### **1. Converted Base64 to Image Files**
- âœ… Extracted your base64 image from `articles.json`
- âœ… Saved it as: `images/articles/how-i-got-started-with-ai-hero.png` (444KB)
- âœ… Updated `articles.json` to reference the image file instead of base64
- âœ… Updated your article HTML to use the image file

### **2. Cleaned Up**
- âœ… Deleted `create-simple.html` (the broken form)
- âœ… Deleted `server.py` (no longer needed)
- âœ… Deleted `extract_images.py` (temporary script)

### **3. Created Documentation**
- âœ… Created `HOW-TO-CREATE-ARTICLES.md` with step-by-step instructions
- âœ… Simple copy/paste workflow for future articles

## **What Changed:**

### **Before:**
```json
"heroImage": "data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAA..." (300,000+ characters!)
```

### **After:**
```json
"heroImage": "../images/articles/how-i-got-started-with-ai-hero.png"
```

**Much cleaner!** ðŸŽ‰
